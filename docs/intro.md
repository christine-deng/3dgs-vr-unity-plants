# Introduction to the Project 

This project was part of my 2025 DOE SULI internship project, overseen by my mentor, [Wei Xu](https://www.bnl.gov/staff/xuw)at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In this project, I utilize Unity as a medium to render and interact with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) plant models. I use aras-p's [Gaussian Splatting playgrounf Unity](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting) project to render the models. I incorporate virtual reality (VR) as a means to interact and visualize the plants.
